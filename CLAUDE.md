## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Checklist Update Rules

**MANDATORY**: Before ANY git commit, you MUST update all related checklists.

### Files to Update
| File | Purpose | When |
|------|---------|------|
| `PLANNER.md` | High-level phase progress | Every task completion |
| `checklist/phase{N}-*.md` | Detailed TDD checklist | Every TDD cycle |

### Update Checklist (Do This EVERY Time)
1. ✅ Change `[ ]` to `[x]` for completed items
2. ✅ Update Progress Summary (Total/Completed/%)
3. ✅ Update "Last Updated" date
4. ✅ Add notes about what was done (e.g., "11 tests passing")

### Warning
```
❌ Failure to update checklists = Incomplete work
❌ NEVER commit code without updating PLANNER.md
❌ NEVER finish a phase without updating the detailed checklist
```

**This is NON-NEGOTIABLE. Always update checklists before committing.**

## 2. User Tiers & Benefits

| Category        | Guest (Non-login)                      | Member (Free)                    | Premium (Paid Subscription) |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Data Logic**  | Completely Random (Duplicates allowed) | No-Duplicate                     | No-Duplicate + Premium DB   |
| **Quantity**    | 1 per day                              | 3 per day                        | 3 per day + 'See 3 More'    |
| **Prayer Note** | Cannot write                           | Write enabled / View last 3 days | Unlimited view of all time  |
| **Archiving**   | Cannot save                            | Save last 7 days records         | Unlimited permanent storage |

### Core Differentiators by Tier

- **Guest**: For trial purposes, offering minimal features to induce sign-up.
- **Member**: Can perform basic spiritual routines, but with limited record retention.
- **Premium**: Access to complete spiritual journey archiving and expanded content.

---

## 3. Core Feature Requirements

### F1. Onboarding Funnel

**Goal**: Convert Guest users to Members.

**Implementation Timing**:

1. **App Launch**
   - Show popup to Guest: "Log in and receive 3 times more grace daily."
2. **Content Exhaustion**
   - When a non-login user finishes reading 1 card and attempts to scroll.
   - Show login induction screen (Blocker).

**Supabase Auth**:

- Google OAuth
- Apple Sign-In
- Email/Password (Optional)

**UX Considerations**:

- Use value-centric messages without being too aggressive.
- Utilize keywords like "Grace", "Wisdom", "Spiritual Growth".

---

### F2. Main Screen (Daily Feed)

**Screen Composition**: Vertical scrolling card format (Flutter ListView/PageView).

**Behavior by Tier**:

1. **Guest**

   - Show only 1 card.
   - Completely random (Same content may appear the next day).
   - Supabase RPC: `get_random_scripture(1, false)`

2. **Member**

   - Provide 3 cards with vertical scrolling.
   - Apply non-duplicate logic (Exclude already viewed).
   - Wait until tomorrow after consuming all 3 for the day.
   - Supabase RPC: `get_daily_scriptures(user_id, 3, false)`

3. **Premium**
   - Provide basic 3 cards (Same as Member).
   - **[Get More Words]** button activates at the bottom after 3 cards.
   - Provide additional 3 from Premium-exclusive DB.
   - Supabase RPC: `get_premium_scriptures(user_id, 3)`

**Supabase Database Structure**:

- `scriptures` table: All scripture content (is_premium flag).
- `user_scripture_history` table: Reading history.
- Row Level Security (RLS) for permission management.

**Navigation & Access**:

- **Library Icon**: Top-right AppBar icon (`Icons.library_books`) before Settings
  - Premium users: Direct access to MyLibrary screen
  - Non-premium users: Shows UpsellDialog with archiveLocked trigger
  - Tooltip: "My Library" for accessibility

---

### F3. Prayer Note

**Writing Feature**:

- Location: Full-width **[Leave Meditation]** button at bottom of scripture card (below category chip).
- Design: Material 3 FilledButton.icon with Icons.edit_note, 56dp height, 16px border radius.
- Accessibility: Proper touch targets (≥ 48dp) and semantic labels.
- Form: Flutter TextField (Multi-line).
- Restriction: Not accessible to Guests (button appears disabled).
- Storage: Real-time saving to Supabase `prayer_notes` table.

**Viewing Feature (Calendar View)**:

- Location: 'My Library' tab.
- UI: Utilize Flutter `table_calendar` package.
- Data: Supabase Realtime Subscription.

**Restrictions by Tier**:

| Tier    | View Range  | Restriction             | Supabase RLS                              |
| ------- | ----------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Guest   | N/A         | Writing impossible      | -                                         |
| Member  | Last 3 days | Lock🔒 on older records | `created_at >= now() - interval '3 days'` |
| Premium | All time    | Unlimited view & edit   | `user_id = auth.uid()`                    |

**Retention Policy**:

- Member: Auto-delete records older than 7 days via Supabase Edge Function.
- Premium: Permanent storage (Protected by RLS policy).

---

### F4. Monetization Model (Upselling)

**Conversion Points**:

1. **Archives (Storage Limit)**

   - Situation: Member attempts to view records older than 3 days.
   - Message: "Revisit past prayers and meditate on the grace."
   - CTA: Guide to Premium Subscription.

2. **More Content (Content Expansion)**
   - Situation: Member exhausts all 3 cards for the day.
   - Message: "Do you need more wisdom today?"
   - CTA: Guide to Premium Subscription.

**Payment System**:

- iOS: In-App Purchase (StoreKit)
- Android: Google Play Billing
- Flutter Package: `in_app_purchase` or `purchases_flutter` (RevenueCat)
- Supabase: Store subscription status in `user_subscriptions` table.

**Pricing Policy**:

- Monthly Subscription: ₩9,900 (Adjustable later)
- Annual Subscription: ₩99,000 (2 months free)

### TDD Core Principles

**Red-Green-Refactor Cycle**:

1. **Red**: Write a failing test first.
2. **Green**: Write the minimum code to pass the test.
3. **Refactor**: Remove duplication and improve code.

**TDD Rules**:

- Do not write production code without a test.
- Do not write a new test without a failing test.
- Write only the minimum code to pass the test.

### Flutter TDD Specifics

**Test Layers**:

1. **Unit Tests**: Business Logic, Service, Repository.
2. **Widget Tests**: UI Components, State Management.
3. **Integration Tests**: Full Flow, Supabase Integration.

**Mocking Strategy**:

- Supabase Client: Mock with `mockito` or `mocktail`.
- Enable local testing without actual DB calls.

### Test Coverage Goals

| Layer                    | Coverage Goal | Priority |
| ------------------------ | ------------- | -------- |
| Repository (Data)        | 95%+          | Highest  |
| Service (Business Logic) | 95%+          | Highest  |
| Provider/BLoC (State)    | 90%+          | High     |
| Widget                   | 80%+          | Medium   |
| Screen                   | 70%+          | Medium   |
| Supabase Edge Functions  | 90%+          | High     |

### Test Tools & Frameworks

**Flutter Testing**:

```yaml
dev_dependencies:
  flutter_test:
    sdk: flutter
  integration_test:
    sdk: flutter
  mockito: ^5.4.0
  mocktail: ^1.0.0
  build_runner: ^2.4.0
```

**Supabase Testing**:

- Build local development environment with Supabase CLI.
- SQL function testing with pgTAP.
- Edge Functions testing with Postman/Insomnia.

**CI/CD**:

- GitHub Actions
- Codemagic (Flutter specialized CI/CD)
- Automated test execution and coverage reports.

### Precautions During TDD

**Do**:

- ✅ Write tests first.
- ✅ Always test Supabase Client with Mocks.
- ✅ Use `pumpWidget` and `pumpAndSettle` for Widget tests.
- ✅ Clearly use `async/await` for asynchronous tests.
- ✅ Ensure each Repository can be tested independently.
- ✅ Include RLS policies in test scenarios.

**Don't**:

- ❌ Do not test with actual Supabase production DB.
- ❌ Do not make actual network calls in UI tests.
- ❌ Do not verify too much logic in Widget tests.
- ❌ Do not create dependencies between tests (Ensure independent execution).
- ❌ Golden tests are not for pixel perfection (For layout verification).

### Checklist Update Rules

> ⚠️ **See Section "CRITICAL: Checklist Update Rules" above for full details.**

**Quick Reference Example**:
```markdown
# Before
- [ ] **[Test]** Write AuthRepository tests

# After
- [x] **[Test]** Write AuthRepository tests (11 tests passing)
```

## 5. Development Principles (Functional Programming Orientation)

This project actively adopts **Functional Programming** principles for a stable and predictable codebase.

### Core Principles

1. **Immutability**

   - Define all data models and state classes as Immutable.
   - When changing data, create a new instance via `copyWith` method instead of modifying the existing object.
   - Recommend using Flutter's `final` keyword and the `freezed` package.

2. **Pure Functions**

   - Write Business Logic (Domain/Service layers) as pure functions whenever possible.
   - Guarantee the same output for the same input and do not change external state.
   - This greatly simplifies test code writing in the TDD environment.

3. **Declarative Programming**

   - Focus on "What" to do rather than "How".
   - UI is expressed as a function of the current State, and rendered declaratively according to state changes.

4. **Side Effect Isolation**

   - Strictly separate operations with side effects like IO (Database, Network) into Repository and Data Source layers.
   - Avoid direct global state access or external API calls within logic.

5. **Expressive Type System**
   - Design so that intentions can be clearly understood just by the function signature.
   - Aim for explicit return types (e.g., Either) rather than throwing exceptions for error handling.
